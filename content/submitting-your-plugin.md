## Submitting to the main repository

The main plugin repository functions via the [Plogon](https://github.com/goatcorp/Plogon) build system. This allows you to submit pull requests containing small TOML metadata files, and it will automatically build and deploy it for you.

The main repository is available [here](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPluginsD17). Follow the instructions in the README, but it boils down to:

- Ensure your plugin meets the requirements
  - See the README for more information
- Fork the repository
- Create a new folder in `testing/live` matching the internal name of your plugin
- Create `manifest.toml` and `images/icon.png` inside of that folder
  - See the README for more information on the manifest and icon
- Create a pull request
- Wait patiently

## Using a custom repository

While it is highly encouraged to submit all plugins to the main repository, sometimes plugin authors may want to build a custom repository. These repositories require users to manually add them in the Dalamud settings.

Repository URLs must link to a raw JSON file, which contains an array of objects. The objects in the array must be the same as the output manifest from [DalamudPackager](https://github.com/goatcorp/DalamudPackager), with the following new properties:

- `DownloadLinkInstall`, `DownloadLinkTesting`, `DownloadLinkUpdate`: link to the `latest.zip` that was generated by DalamudPackager
- `RepoUrl`: link to where your repository is hosted
- `LastUpdate`: Unix timestamp in seconds of when the plugin was last updated
- `IconUrl` (optional): link to a raw PNG file to use as the icon

When updating your plugin, bump `AssemblyVersion` and change `LastUpdate`, or the plugin will not update for your users.
